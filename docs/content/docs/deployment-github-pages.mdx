## Can Fumadocs Run on GitHub Pages?

Yes, as long as the docs app is built as a static export.

GitHub Pages serves static files only, so the Fumadocs site must export static HTML/CSS/JS (no always-on Node.js server).

## How This Repo Is Configured

This docs app uses Next.js static export in `docs/next.config.mjs`:

- `output: 'export'`
- `trailingSlash: true`
- repo-aware `basePath` and `assetPrefix` for GitHub Pages project URLs
- `images.unoptimized = true` for static export compatibility

The GitHub Actions workflow builds the site from `docs/` and uploads `docs/out/` to GitHub Pages.

## Important Limitations (Static Hosting)

A GitHub Pages deployment cannot use runtime server features. Keep docs pages static and build-time generated.

Examples of features that should be avoided (or redesigned) for Pages:

- runtime API routes
- runtime SSR-only features
- anything requiring a persistent Node.js server

## Search on Static Hosting (Orama)

Search is still possible on GitHub Pages.

This docs site uses Fumadocs built-in Orama search in static mode:

- search route uses `staticGET` (pre-rendered search index output)
- search client uses `type: 'static'` in the browser

This keeps the site compatible with GitHub Pages while preserving built-in docs search.

## Workflow File

The Pages workflow is in:

- `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`

Before using it:

1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (GitHub Actions deployment).
2. Confirm your default branch name matches the workflow trigger (`main` by default).
