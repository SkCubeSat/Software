description: Clone the repository, configure GitHub SSH access, and learn how to contribute.

## Setup

To get started, first clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/SkCubeSat/Software"
```

or:

```bash
git clone "git@github.com:SkCubeSat/Software.git"
```

## Using SSH with GitHub

GitHub no longer allows password authentication for Git operations. Use SSH keys instead.

These instructions mimic how you would set things up on the `radsat-server` computer. Tailor them as needed for your own machine.

### 1. Generate an SSH key pair

You can skip this if you already have an SSH key pair you want to use.

Replace the email below with the email associated with your GitHub account:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Following the prompts, you can choose to add a passphrase. This is optional, but recommended for added security (especially on shared systems / the linuxbox).

### 2. Start the SSH agent

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

### 3. Add your private key to the SSH agent

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 4. Copy your public key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Paste the public key into your GitHub SSH keys settings.

For more info, see [GitHub's SSH documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
