title: "Getting Started with KubOS and Rust"
---

This document will cover getting started using Rust for local KubOS development. You will need to have the build dependencies listed in [local build dependencies](/docs/kubos/getting-started/local-setup#build-dependencies) installed prior to using Rust. After these dependencies have been installed, you are ready to begin creating and running your own Rust projects.

## New Project

A new Rust project can be created by running the following command:

```
$ cargo new project_name

```
Cargo will create the project folder and a basic folder structure. It is suggested that you create custom mission applications or services outside of the Kubos source repo, preferably in your own project's repo folder.

## Compiling and Running

To compile the project use the normal Cargo build command:

```
$ cargo build

```
This command should be run from within the project's directory, which was generated by the `cargo new` command.

The resulting binary will be located in <span className="title-ref">\{project directory\}/target/debug/\{project name\}</span>.

The binary can be run locally using the `cargo run` command. Any desired arguments can be passed to the underlying executable by placing them behind `--` like so:

```
$ cargo run -- -c config.toml

```
## Making Rust Binaries Smaller

By default, Rust binaries can be quite large. These are some steps which we recommend in order to drastically shrink the size of your compiled application:

- Do a release build, rather than a debug build (`cargo build --release`)

- Add the following optimization args to your <span className="title-ref">Cargo.toml</span> file and recompile:

  ```
  [profile.release]
  lto = true
  opt-level = "z"
  panic = "abort"
  codegen-units = 1
  
  ```
- After the binary has been built, run `arm-linux-strip /path/to/binary`

## Next Steps

Ready to create a mission application in Rust? Take a look at the [Python mission application](../tutorials/first-mission-app) tutorial for guidance in the construction of a mission application. The [example rust mission application](https://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/rust-mission-app) is a good model for a Rust-based mission application.
