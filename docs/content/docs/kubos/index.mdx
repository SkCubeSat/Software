## Kubos Docs (Migrating)

This section is a staged migration of the legacy KubOS Sphinx documentation from:

- `kubos/docs/`

The first pass migrates the main landing pages and section indexes so navigation is available in Fumadocs. Some links may still point to pages that have not been converted yet.

## Sections

- [KubOS Design](./kubos-design)
- [Getting Started](./getting-started)
- [Tutorials](./tutorials)
- [Working With an OBC](./obc-docs)
- [Mission Development](./mission-dev)
- [KubOS Ecosystem](./ecosystem)
- [Under the Hood](./deep-dive)
- [KubOS SDK Docs](./sdk-docs)
- [Contributing to KubOS](./contributing)

## Next Migration Steps

- Convert remaining pages inside each section
- Migrate FAQ and changelog pages
- Clean up cross-links and anchors after the full content import
