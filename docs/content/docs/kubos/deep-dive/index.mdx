These docs give a more detailed examination of the inner workings of KubOS

## APIs

Kubos provides a variety of APIs to help with the development of mission software:

> - [Device Interfaces](apis/device-api/index) - APIs for external devices (ex. radio), built on top of the Kubos HAL
> - [OBC APIs](apis/obc-api/index) - APIs for features which are internal to a particular OBC
> - [Kubos HAL](apis/kubos-hal/index) - Hardware interface abstractions (I2C, SPI, etc)
> - [Kubos Libraries](apis/kubos-libs) - Non-hardware libraries

## Protocols

Intra-satellite communication is generally handled using HTTP over TCP/IP, with the packet payloads being structured as [GraphQL](../ecosystem/services/graphql) requests or JSON responses.

For procedures which require space-ground communication, special care has been taken to craft protocols which can handle higher rates of packet loss and function well in the more asynchronous comms environment.

> [!NOTE]
> We are currently working on a dedicated Space Ground Interface Control Document to highlight this expected link behavior.

## Kubos Linux

While Kubos does create and distribute official releases of Kubos Linux, users are free to create their own builds. This allows KubOS to be easily customized on a per-mission basis.

Users will most likely want to create their own builds when they create new hardware services which should be included in the OS' root file system.

## Design Decisions

When developing new features for KubOS, we frequently have to make a choice between two or more tools/libraries/frameworks which will most closely give us our desired characteristics.

The design decisions doc give a quick summary of how we have decided on our particular toolset.
