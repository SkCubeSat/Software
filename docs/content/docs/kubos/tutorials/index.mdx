Kubos users develop custom flight software for their OBCs using the KubOS libraries.

This custom software is then used to communicate with the various [core](../ecosystem/services/core-services) and [hardware](../ecosystem/services/hardware-services) services in order to interact with the system and execute mission logic.

folder "Host Machine" {

}

node "OBC - KubOS" {  
frame "App Registry" {  
cloud "kubos-proj2" as application cloud "App1" cloud "App2"

}

rectangle "Process Monitor Service" as monitor rectangle "Telemetry Database Service" as telemdb rectangle "Hardware Service \#1" as hw1

}

User -> proj1 proj2 -> application User -> proj2 application ..> monitor application ..> telemdb application ..> hw1

This series of tutorials will walk a new user through the major steps required to program a mission and then communicate with a system once it is in-flight.

> [!NOTE]
> You should be able to go through these tutorials from either a [local dev environment](../getting-started/local-setup) or an instance of the [Kubos SDK](../sdk-docs/sdk-installing)

## Mission Development Tutorials

After the completion of these tutorials, the user will have created a mission application capable of querying their hardware for telemetry data and then storing that data into the telemetry database.

## System Interaction Tutorials

These tutorials cover all of the ways a user might directly interact with a system from the ground.

There is no coding required for these actions, however some scripting may used for example purposes.

The first two tutorials may be run entirely locally. The file and shell service tutorials are written to be used with an OBC.

## Advanced Tutorials

Important system tutorials which should be approached after mastering basic system interaction.
