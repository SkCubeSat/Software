title: "Working with KubOS and an OBC"
---

After getting your [development environment](../getting-started/local-setup) set up and playing around with the [basics of KubOS](../tutorials/index), you can move on to interacting with hardware.

In this section, you'll find the following docs:

- `cross-compile` - Details the process required to compile code (C, Rust, etc) for a target OBC rather than your host computer
- `comms-setup` - Covers the possible ways to communicate with an OBC (serial, ethernet, etc) and how to set up the necessary connections
- [bbb/index](bbb/index) - Documentation specifically geared for the Beaglebone Black. Includes installation instructions and a system overview doc
- [iobc/index](iobc/index) - Documentation specifically geared for the Pumpkin MBM2. Includes installation instructions and a system overview doc
- [mbm2/index](mbm2/index) - Documentation specifically geared for the ISIS OBC. Includes installation instructions and a system overview doc
- `porting-kubos` - A high-level guide of how to set up KubOS for a currently unsupported OBC
