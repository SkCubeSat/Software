## Debug Console Connection

As documented in section 7.5 of the <span className="title-ref">Beaglebone Black System Reference Manual</span>, an FTDI cable can be connected to the serial debug connector in order to establish a debug console connection.

This connection will be passed through to a Kubos Vagrant image as <span className="title-ref">/dev/FTDI</span>.

## Ethernet Connection

Please refer to our [ethernet overview](/docs/kubos/obc-docs/comms-setup#ethernet) for help setting up an SSH connection over ethernet.

## Peripherals

By default, KubOS exposes the following peripheral components:

- Ethernet
- 2 I2C buses
- 1 SPI bus
- 5 UART buses
- 7 ADC pins
- Many GPIO pins

More information about these peripheral devices can be found in the `working-with-the-bbb` doc.
